# plumegang_unity
Little (early version) 2d game coded in ~~Python with Pyglet~~ Unity C# :D
new version of the original plumegang lesgo


### **DESCRIPTION**
You are a little rappeur in a new city to explore :

You begin in your own house and you need to earn money


Each day you lose some money and if you hit the 0$ bottom, this is a sad GAME OVER


In order to make money, you need to create and release 'sons' *(songs)*.

To create songs, you have to write some 'phases' *(lyrics)* in your bed with your 'plume' *(feather)*.

You also need to find an 'instru' *(instrumental)* and there you go !

**4 phases + 1 instru = 1 son**

Use the things in your house to make all this stuff !


***

### **FOR NOW**

For now the game is in a very early version so don't expect to see every thing right now hehe (cheh)

You can walk around using Z,S,Q,D (azerty keyboard lezgoo), and activate things around by long-hitting Z or S.
You can click with the mouse on the screen to move items in inventories OR to show the message screen -> use it to say things.
If you want to hit bots you need to activate the FIGHT MODE using ***F***.
You can scroll the mouse to select the item you want to use (like in minecraft)

You can also use the train (sbahn) to move faster inside the city
